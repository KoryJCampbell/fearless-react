## How To Build & Run The Solution

* Clone the repo down to your terminal of choice
* Run `npm install` to install the necessary node modules for application
* Run `npm start` to start the application to default server --> localhost:3000
* Port server can be custom configured to run on any port available using `"start": "PORT=**** react-scripts start"` command
* Alternatively, you can configue the port server by editing the angular-cli.json file in "scripts" "start" number

## Future Updates

* Ideally this application would be further developed for adding other features. Maybe a indivual id for each specific user.
* Components could possibly be broken further down ex. {Header, Button, Footer} components depending on functionality added.
* Application was built to have simple archetecture for each component so the application would not be unnessesarily overengineered.

* I decided to do this project for fun as extra credit to compare the archetecture between Angular & React. 

* For fun, I would add an animation library or use features in CSS to add animations for the cow.
